## üìù **Recommendations**

1. **Increase Table Booking & Online Delivery Features**: Currently, only 12% and 26% of restaurants offer these features. Promoting them could significantly enhance user engagement.
2. **Focus on Key Cuisines**: Despite high votes, popular cuisines like North Indian and Chinese have low ratings (2.7 stars and 2.8 stars). Improving service quality could lead to better ratings.
3. **Geographical Focus**: New Delhi and Noida need attention, especially in the pizza segment, where premium restaurants are lacking. Targeting these areas can help boost customer engagement.
